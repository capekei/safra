# SafraReport Admin Panel Access Guide

## 🚀 Quick Access (Development Mode)

### Option 1: Development Admin Route (Recommended)
Simply visit: **http://localhost:4000/dev-admin/dashboard**

✅ **No Auth0 setup required**

✅ **Bypasses authentication in development**

### Option 2: Standard Admin Route

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### 1. **Client-Side Configuration**
- ✅ Created `/client/.env` with Auth0 variables
- ✅ Added development token bypass in API client

### 2. **Server-Side Development Mode**
- ✅ Modified `auth-middleware.ts` to accept dev tokens
- ✅ Auto-creates development admin user in database
- ✅ Bypasses Auth0 JWT verification in development

### 3. **Routing Updates**
- ✅ Added `/dev-admin/*` routes that bypass Auth0
- ✅ Updated admin layout to work with both paths
- ✅ Development mode detection in components
